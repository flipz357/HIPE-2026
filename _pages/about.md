### HIPE-2026: Evaluating Accurate and Efficient Person–Place Relation Extraction

Building on the success of HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022, the third edition of the HIPE shared task explores the extraction of **person–place relations** in **multilingual historical documents**. Participants will develop systems that help uncover implicit and explicit connections between people and places across time, contributing to research in historical knowledge graphs, spatial humanities, and biographical reconstruction.

For full details on task setup, data, and evaluation criteria, please see the [Tasks & Data](/tasks) page.

### Evaluation Profiles

HIPE-2026 features two evaluation profiles:

1. **Accuracy Profile** – Focusing on system performance in relation classification.
2. **Efficiency Profile** – Rewarding scalable, lightweight approaches considering model size and compute cost.

An unseen dataset from a different domain will be included to test generalization.

### About the Previous Edition (HIPE-2022)

HIPE-2022 expanded the HIPE evaluation series by introducing multilingual corpora, more complex document types, and diverse annotation tagsets. Participants were challenged to build systems that could cope with OCR noise, partial knowledge base coverage, and historical language variation. See the [HIPE-2022 website](https://impresso.github.io/CLEF-HIPE-2022/) for details.
